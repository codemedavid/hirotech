# 🔒 Fix ENCRYPTION_KEY Error

## ⚠️ Error: "Encryption configuration error. Please check ENCRYPTION_KEY environment variable."

## ✅ Solution Steps

### Step 1: Verify ENCRYPTION_KEY is Set in Vercel

1. **Go to Vercel Dashboard:**
   - Visit: https://vercel.com/dashboard
   - Select project: `hirotechofficial-beta`
   - Go to **Settings** → **Environment Variables**

2. **Check ENCRYPTION_KEY:**
   - Look for `ENCRYPTION_KEY`
   - Should be set for: ✅ Production, ✅ Preview, ✅ Development
   - Value should be: `f902ad293f5f9af42c98b007dfdc0eede8614ac2be7a985c23347e051f3bcf81`

### Step 2: Test if ENCRYPTION_KEY is Accessible

Visit this URL to test:
```
https://hirotechofficial-beta.vercel.app/api/test-encryption
```

**Expected Response (if working):**
```json
{
  "status": "ok",
  "message": "ENCRYPTION_KEY is valid",
  "details": {
    "hasKey": true,
    "keyLength": 64,
    "expectedLength": 64,
    "isValidLength": true,
    "isValidHex": true,
    "keyPrefix": "f902ad29..."
  }
}
```

**If you see an error:**
- The ENCRYPTION_KEY might not be accessible at runtime
- You may need to redeploy after adding the variable

### Step 3: Redeploy (If Needed)

If the test endpoint shows the key is missing:

```bash
# Force redeploy to pick up environment variables
vercel --prod --yes --force
```

### Step 4: Verify After Redeploy

1. Wait 1-2 minutes for deployment to complete
2. Test the endpoint again: `https://hirotechofficial-beta.vercel.app/api/test-encryption`
3. Try adding an API key in `/settings/api-keys`

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Issue: Key is set but still getting error

**Possible causes:**
1. **Deployment happened before env var was added** → Redeploy
2. **Key format is wrong** → Must be exactly 64 hex characters
3. **Key has extra spaces** → Check for leading/trailing spaces

### Issue: Test endpoint shows key is missing

**Solution:**
1. Double-check the key is set in Vercel Dashboard
2. Make sure it's enabled for **Production**
3. Redeploy: `vercel --prod --yes --force`

### Issue: Key length is wrong

**Solution:**
Generate a new key:
```bash
npx tsx scripts/generate-encryption-key.ts
```

Then update in Vercel Dashboard.
