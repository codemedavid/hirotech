# ✅ NVIDIA API - Database Storage Setup Complete!

**Great news!** You **NO LONGER need to add the API key to Vercel manually**. The NVIDIA API key can now be stored in your **database** and managed through the **UI**.

---

## 🎉 What Changed

### Before:
- ❌ Had to manually add `NVIDIA_API_KEY` to Vercel environment variables
- ❌ Had to update Vercel every time you wanted to change the key
- ❌ Keys stored in environment variables only

### Now:
- ✅ API keys stored securely in **database** (encrypted)
- ✅ Add/remove keys through **Settings → API Keys** in the UI
- ✅ Automatic key rotation if you add multiple keys
- ✅ Rate limit handling - keys automatically disabled if rate-limited
- ✅ Still falls back to environment variables if no database keys exist

## 🚀 How to Add Your NVIDIA API Key

### Option 1: Through the UI (Recommended - No Vercel needed!)

1. **Get your NVIDIA API key** from [build.nvidia.com](https://build.nvidia.com/)
   - Should start with `nvapi-`

2. **Login to your app** (locally or on Vercel)

3. **Go to Settings → API Keys**
   - Navigate to: `/settings/integrations` or look for "API Keys" section

4. **Click "Add API Key"**

5. **Paste your NVIDIA API key**
   - Format: `nvapi-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx`
   - Optional: Give it a name like "NVIDIA Primary Key"

6. **Click "Add"**

7. **Done!** ✅ The key is now stored in your database and will be used automatically.

### Option 2: Through Environment Variable (Fallback)

If you prefer, you can still use environment variables as a fallback:

**Local (`.env.local`):**
```env
NVIDIA_API_KEY=nvapi-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
```

**Vercel:**
- Only needed if you don't want to use the database method
- Add `NVIDIA_API_KEY` in Vercel Dashboard → Environment Variables

---

## 🔄 How It Works

1. **Priority Order:**
   - First tries to get key from **database** (via API Key Manager)
   - Falls back to `NVIDIA_API_KEY` environment variable
   - Falls back to `GOOGLE_AI_API_KEY` environment variable

2. **Key Rotation:**
   - If you add multiple NVIDIA API keys, they'll rotate automatically
   - If one gets rate-limited, it automatically switches to the next

3. **Automatic Management:**
   - Keys marked as "rate-limited" if they hit rate limits
   - Keys marked as "disabled" if authentication fails
   - Success/failure tracking for each key

## 📋 What You Need to Do

### ✅ Required:
1. **Get NVIDIA API key** from [build.nvidia.com](https://build.nvidia.com/)
2. **Add it through the UI** (Settings → API Keys)
3. **That's it!** No Vercel configuration needed!

### ⚠️ Optional (Only if you want environment variable fallback):
- Add `NVIDIA_API_KEY` to `.env.local` for local development
- Add `NVIDIA_API_KEY` to Vercel if you want environment variable backup

## 🧪 Testing

1. **Start your dev server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Check console logs** - You should see:
   ```
   [NVIDIA] Model Configuration:
     Model: openai/gpt-oss-20b
     BaseURL: https://integrate.api.nvidia.com/v1
   ```

3. **Test AI features:**
   - Sync a contact from Facebook
   - Check if AI Context analysis works
   - Look for `[NVIDIA]` logs in the console

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### "No API key available" error
**Solution:**
1. Go to Settings → API Keys
2. Make sure you've added at least one NVIDIA API key
3. Check that the key status is "ACTIVE"

### "401 Unauthorized" error
**Solution:**
1. Check your NVIDIA API key is valid
2. Verify it starts with `nvapi-`
3. Check the key is active in NVIDIA dashboard
4. The system will automatically mark invalid keys as "DISABLED"

### Keys not showing in UI
**Solution:**
- Make sure you're logged in as an **ADMIN** user
- API Keys management requires admin role

## 📊 Benefits of Database Storage

✅ **No Vercel configuration needed** - Add keys through UI  
✅ **Secure** - Keys are encrypted in the database  
✅ **Easy management** - Add/remove/disable keys without redeploying  
✅ **Multiple keys** - Add multiple keys for rotation  
✅ **Automatic handling** - Rate limits and failures tracked automatically  
✅ **UI management** - See key status, usage stats, etc.

---

## 🎯 Summary

**You can now add your NVIDIA API key through the UI - no Vercel environment variables needed!**

Just:
1. Get your NVIDIA API key (`nvapi-...`)
2. Go to Settings → API Keys in your app
3. Add the key
4. Done! ✅

The system will automatically use it for all AI features.
